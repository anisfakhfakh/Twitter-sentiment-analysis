# Twitter sentiment analysis
This project is a part of a School project.
My other projects will be porgressively uploaded at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/anisfakhfakh).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Objective
The objective of this peoject is to build a model capable of predicting the sentiment of a tweet from a labeled dataset using Machine learning and natural language processing techniques. 


### Methods Used
* Natural Nalguage processing
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Analysis
* Data cleaning
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* NLTK
* RegEX
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit Learn
* WordCloud
* etc. 

## Project Description
The project uses the data: tweets and their labels and supervised machine learning techniques in order to predict a binary Sentiment state (positive or negative). The learning phase is implmented after the prorocessing: cleaning + tokeninzing + vectorizing

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip) within this link.
3. Extract the csv file training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv in the Data folder.
4. Imports are being kept [here](https://github.com/anisfakhfakh/Twitter-sentiment-analysis/blob/main/imports.py)
5. The notebook contains the whole project useing ressources from the Data folder and .py files.



## Credits
1. https://github.com/tthustla for the clear steps he used through the project which helped me succeed my first NLP project
2. Data credits by Stanford university
