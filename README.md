# Twitter sentiment analysis
This project is a part of a School project.
My other projects will be porgressively uploaded at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/anisfakhfakh).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Objective
The objective of this peoject is to build a model capable of predicting the sentiment of a tweet from a labeled dataset using Machine learning and natural language processing techniques. 


### Methods Used
* Natural Nalguage processing
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Analysis
* Data cleaning
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* NLTK
* RegEX
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit Learn
* WordCloud
* etc. 

## Project Description
The project uses the data: tweets and their labels and supervised machine learning techniques in order to predict a binary Sentiment state (positive or negative). The learning phase is implmented after the prorocessing: cleaning + tokeninzing + vectorizing

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
